# Tasks Directory

This directory contains technical implementation plans generated by the **LEAD Agent**.

## Purpose

Each task file provides a detailed breakdown of how to implement a feature from an issue, including:
- Technical analysis
- Component architecture
- API endpoints needed
- Database schema changes
- Step-by-step development plan
- Complexity estimates
- Best practices and guidelines

## Naming Convention

Task files follow this format:
```
TASK-YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md
```

Example: `TASK-2025-11-06-home-page-implementation.md`

## How Tasks Are Generated

Tasks are created by the LEAD agent by:
1. Reading the issue file from `docs/issues/`
2. Analyzing project documentation (STACK, API, DATABASE)
3. Breaking down requirements into atomic, implementable tasks
4. Providing detailed technical specifications

## Usage

Developers should:
1. Read the complete task file before starting implementation
2. Follow the phases in order (Database → API → Frontend → Integration)
3. Check off completed tasks as they progress
4. Reference the linked documentation and mockups
5. Ensure all acceptance criteria are met before marking complete
