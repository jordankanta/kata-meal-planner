# Project Rules - MealPrep Kata

## Global Communication Rules

### Markdown & Documentation (from docs/rules/MARKDOWN.md)
- Be as concise as possible in all responses and generated content
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity
- Focus on clarity and brevity

## Project Structure

When generating or modifying files, respect this structure:
- `docs/agents/` - Agent prompt definitions (LEAD, DEV, etc.)
- `docs/issues/` - Feature requests and bug reports
- `docs/tasks/` - Implementation plans generated from issues
- `docs/memory-bank/` - Project documentation (STACK, API, DATABASE, PROJECT_BRIEF)
- `docs/prompts/` - Reusable prompt templates
- `docs/rules/` - Project-wide rules and conventions

## File Generation Standards

### When creating agent files (docs/agents/):
- Include clear role definition
- Specify required reading (memory-bank docs)
- Define input/output format
- Include process steps
- Provide examples

### When creating memory-bank files (docs/memory-bank/):
- Be concise and factual
- Use clear headings and structure
- Keep updated with current state
- Include code examples where relevant

### When creating task files (docs/tasks/):
- Follow TASK-YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md naming
- Include complexity estimates (S/M/L/XL)
- Break down into atomic subtasks
- Specify exact file paths
- Include acceptance criteria

## Code Standards

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow existing project patterns
- Include proper error handling
- Write tests for new features
- Document complex logic

## General Behavior

- Always check existing documentation before creating new files
- Maintain consistency with existing patterns
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Provide specific, actionable outputs
- Reference related files when appropriate
